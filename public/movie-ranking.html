<h1>Sam's Favorite Movies</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Goodfellas</h3>
 <p>At times it's darkly humourous. At other times, it's thought-provoking and reflective. The way Martin Scorsese takes the emphasis away from a character's death is so interesting and gripping.</p>
 <h3>Big Fish</h3>
 <p>Reminds me of my relationship with my own father. Funny, emotional, and uplifting. Tim Burton's best.</p>
 <h3>Wayne's World</h3>
 <p>
   A total guilty pleasure of mine and my friends. So funny and quotable.
