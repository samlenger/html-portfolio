<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Sam Lenger and I am the B2B Coordinator for the Veterans Canteen Service, an organization within the US Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   In this role, I facilitate the sales of promotional products and decorated apparel across all the VA Medical Centers in the country. 
   My previous roles include Assistant Branch Manager with Enterprise Holdings Co., and Territory Sales Manager with Big River Marketing, my family's business.
   I'm driven by a passion and desire to learn, and to never feel stagnant in my progress. I would consider myself a "forever student."
</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Washington, MO, and still find myself living here. I'm a 2019 graduate of Westminster College in Fulton, MO, where I received my BA in Business Administration and Marketing. Fun fact, Westmisnter was where Winston Churchill
  gave his famous "Sinews of Peace" speech. AKA the "Iron Curtain" speech. Originally recruited to play on the soccer team, I only lasted my freshman year due to my second ACL tear,
  but remained on campus because of my love for the school. I was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity on campus, where I elected as the House Secretary, an executive position,
  because of my attention to detail, typing skills, and superior organization.
</p>

<p>Much of my free time is spent amongst my family and friends. I love to run, a hobby I picked up after I quit the soccer team. It's the perfect activity to keep me striving for improvement,
   while being relatively easy on my bad knee. I ran in the Go STL Marathon in 2023, finishing in 4:00:06, just a few seconds away from my goal of sub 4-hour. Other than running, I thoroughly
   enjoy casually playing video games, fishing, attending St. Louis sports games, and being involved in soccer. I recently started my first year as an Assistant Coach for the men's team at Washington High School,
   my alma mater. As much as I used to love to play, coaching has instilled a whole new love of the game I never thought would be possible. 
</p>

<p>I've always had a keen interest in computers and their functionality. After spending 5 unfulfilling years in the business, marketing, and sales landscape, I finally decided it was time 
   to put that interest and turn it into a profession. The journey will be extensive and difficult, but I'm passionate about my future, and I see my future in programming.
